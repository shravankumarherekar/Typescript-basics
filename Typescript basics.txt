typescript takes file default as script to make them module write import/export at start

module has own scope where script shares global scope

whenever we do changes in tsc file it will refelct directly in js file this is how it works (ts to js transfile )

tsc main --watch it will monitor the file 

typescript let , const mostly used

js only gobal scope,function scope

--variable declarations

let -can be done without intilazation
const require intilization and cannot be reassign
